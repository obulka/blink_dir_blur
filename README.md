# Blink Script Directional Blur
#### Created by Owen Bulka and Riley Gray

This group node allows the user to combine linear, zoom, and radial blurs into a single computation. It is implemented in Blink Script to run on the GPU, and operates much faster than Nuke's built in directional blur. Additional functionality includes the ability to blur individual channels.
